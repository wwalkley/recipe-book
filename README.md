# What is this application?

This project was built to learn the basics of Angular. The application is a basic recipe book with a list of recipes and ingredients for each recipe. The application also has a shoppling list functionality. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.


## What I learnt? 

How to use Bootstrap, Angular CLI, Angular Framework & TypeScript.

More specifically in Angular: databinding, directives, components, routing/navigation, dependency injection, modules, optimization, RESTful servers, pipe lines, custom directives, authentication, services, Http Access & general Angular architechture.  


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
